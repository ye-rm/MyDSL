awesomeDSL is a simple DSL, which helps you build your own bot. support basic data types, such as integer, boolean, string, array have builtin functions, such as len, first, last, rest, push support user defined function support if\-else statement support user defined function Example for a simple program:

By setting env in your shell, awesomeDSL support openai-api, please check [doc](./doc/README.md) for more details.

the DSL is crazy simple, but it's enough for a simple bot

`let question_without_space` = variable, function call, if-else statement, builtin function

when you type question, the bot will answer you with value at right of `=`

for example, 

with `let a = 1`, when you type 'a', the bot will answer you with '1'

for more examples, please check in [examples](./example/)
```
//builtin function
let hello = puts("hello world");
//variables
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = true;
let d = "hello world";
//define function 
let add = fn(x, y) {
	x + y;
};
//call function
let result = add(a, b);
//if-else statement
let tellmeresult= if (result > 0) {
	"result is positive";
} else {
	"result is negative";
};
//array
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
//array builtin function
let first = first(arr);
let last = last(arr);
let rest = rest(arr);
//array push
let arr2 = push(arr, 4);
//array len
let len = len(arr2);
//array index
let index = arr2[0];
//string concat
let len = "hello"+" world";
```
